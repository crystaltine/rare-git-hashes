# Find your rarest git hashes!
Searches through the entire git commit history (across all branches) of a specified git repository and finds the ones with the **most letters** and the **most numbers**
- git hashes are 40 hex digits long, so theres a `10/16` chance for each one to be a number and `6/16` for each one to be a letter
